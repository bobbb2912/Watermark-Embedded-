/**
 * The chirp z-transform.  Calculates the z-transform of a vector of length N along a 
 * discrete set of points on a spiral arc in the z plane represented by AW^k where A and W 
 * are complex numbers and k = 0,1,...,M-1.
 * 
 * Described in the classic paper 
 * L. Rabiner, R. Schafer and C. Rader, "The Chirp z-Transform algorithm and its application",
 * Bell Systems Technical Journal, May-June 1969
 * 
 * If the chirp z-transform is the be computing on the unit circle thin much can be gained
 * by using Complex.UnitCircle for A and W.  The transform is both faster, and more
 * stable if this is done.
